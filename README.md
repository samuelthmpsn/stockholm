### Getting started

To run, make sure you have node installed on your computer. Type `node install` in Google and go through the
installation etc. At that point you'll have access to the `npm` package.

Change directory `cd` into the `frontend` folder and run `npm install`. This will install all of the relevant packages
you need to run the NextJS application.

Once that is done, run `npm run dev`. This will start a locally hosted version of the application!
